# Sauron Holocron
This is a Lord of the Rings themed Holocron. 

What is a Holocron?  A Holocron is a Star Wars ancient repository of knowledge and wisdom that can only be accessed by those skilled in the Force. In Star Wars, Jedi use them to record and preserve their teachings, creating a record for future generations seeking to understand the mysteries of the Force.

This is a "What if" scenario where we imagine Sauron was a Sith Lord and created a Sith Holocron.

This project was created with the help of this Thingiverse model: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3565057 

### 3D Printing Directions
I printed all the models with a resin printer (Saturn 2).
* Elegoo 405nm Standard Resin Grey 1000g
* Elegoo 405nm Standard Resin Clear Red 500g
The printed the STL models at 175% scale.


### Arduino Prerequisites
* Some experience with [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/)
* Be sure to have the Arduino Nano board installed in your environment.
* Install the [Bounce2](https://github.com/thomasfredericks/Bounce2) library.
* Install the [ButtonEvents](https://github.com/fasteddy516/ButtonEvents) library.
* Install the [DFPlayer Mini Fast](https://github.com/PowerBroker2/DFPlayerMini_Fast) library
If you alter the number of LEDs you use, be sure to change the code "NUM_LEDS" to reflect this.
